# Event Management System

## Overview

The Event Management System is a web application built using Django, a Python web framework. It provides functionality for users to create, manage, and register for events. The system ensures user authentication, allowing only registered users to participate in events. Additionally, it features a user-friendly interface and a basic search functionality.

## Features

- **User Registration:** New users can create accounts, providing their basic details such as first name, last name, username, email, and password.

- **Event Creation:** Users can create events with details such as title, description, date, time, location name, and maximum available slots.

- **Event Registration:** Registered users can sign up for events, with a limit on the number of available slots.

- **User Authentication:** Only authenticated users can register for events. Users are only allowed to unregister from events they've previously registered for.

- **Admin Panel:** Django's admin panel is utilized for managing events and user registrations. Admins have control over the system's data.

- **Search Functionality:** A basic search functionality is implemented, allowing users to find events based on keywords.

- **User Dashboard:** Users have access to a personalized dashboard where they can view and manage the events they've registered for.

- **API Endpoints (Django Rest Framework):** API endpoints are created for listing all events, providing details of a specific event, user registration for an event, and fetching a user's registered events.
